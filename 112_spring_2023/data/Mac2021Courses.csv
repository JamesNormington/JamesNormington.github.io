European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.","Writing WA

Military activity enabled the work of key founding figures of this tradition; e.g., Charles Darwin’s critical insights were made as part of a British naval expedition whose ultimate goal was to maintain and expand colonial power.  This approach to understanding nature has been practiced through striking traditions of drawing, printmaking, taxidermy, and cabinets of curiosities.

The goal is not to survey the entirety of Japanese literature – that would be impossible! – but to instead grapple with the larger socio-cultural trends reflected in fiction and their relation to the larger global context. Authors studied include Kirino Natsuo (Grotesque), Project Itoh (Harmony), Shun Medoruma (In the Woods of Memory), Motoya Yukiko (The Lonesome Bodybuilder), and Murata Sayaka (Convenience Store Woman). We will learn the basic history of contemporary Japanese literature as well as some approaches to studying it. In the first half of the course we will concentrate on literature engaging with large societal issues and learn how to recognize the way authors draw on the world around them and “translate” it into fiction. In the second half we will shift to less explicitly political pieces. We will continue to pay attention to the political characteristics of the text, but will spend more time thinking about how they relate to contemporary life, especially how they reflect upon, critique, re-imagine, and/or recapitulate aspects of contemporary society. Our discussions will also focus on how literature’s exploration of these issues relates not only to Japan’s particular history and culture but how these trends are shaped by globalization, the internet, and transnational desirability.","Writing WA

Students in our collaborative First-Year Course will explore this question from historical, artistic, and scientific perspectives.

Military activity enabled the work of key founding figures of this tradition; e.g., Charles Darwin’s critical insights were made as part of a British naval expedition whose ultimate goal was to maintain and expand colonial power.  This approach to understanding nature has been practiced through striking traditions of drawing, printmaking, taxidermy, and cabinets of curiosities. Students will confront the practices and institutions of the biodiversity sciences in historical and political context.  We will engage with indigenous counter-narratives and approaches to understanding nature outside of normative European colonial practices.  Finally, we will work together to think critically about how we might decolonize institutions such as museums of natural history, approaches to visual culture and the biodiversity sciences more generally. Course activities will include active visual interpretation of nature through the production of artistic works, fieldtrips to museums such as the Minnesota Insect Collection and the Bell Museum of Natural History, and interpretation of archival materials such as Macalester’s Encyclopedie (Diderot), the Wangensteen Library’s Surinaamsche insecten engravings by Maria Sibylla Merian or the Science Museum of Minnesota’s Amazonian collection.

Human history, culture and socio-political nuances in different parts of the world result in distinctive challenges as well as enigmatically optimistic scenarios with respect to wildlife conservation. In this seminar we will investigate perspectives from South Asia where animals and humans coexist at very high density and proximity, consider the North American system where views about biodiversity can often be very polarizing, and explore conservation in Africa where pockets of pristine wilderness persist. We will engage with the primary literature of wildlife conservation, hear from scientists on the frontlines, and discuss the idea that there could be a unifying model that safeguards biodiversity without detrimentally impeding human development.

This course is comprised of two primary elements: 1) a theoretical component that introduces the more advanced theories of international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) and 2) an applied component that discusses the role of multinational corporations and exporters in shaping globalization. The theories developed in this class expose students to the current paradigm in the international trade and FDI literatures focused on heterogeneous firm-level analysis. These derivations provide a sound platform from which to evaluate the causes and consequences of international trade and FDI and provide a natural transition for contemplating the role of exporting firms and multinational corporations in shaping globalization. Throughout this applied component of the course, we will examine issues, such as the role of productivity and diversity in entering foreign markets, the labor market effects in home and host countries, the correlation with economic development and inequality, convergence or polarization of global cultures, and issues related to international trade policy and transportation.

How will the promises of technology, or the lethal threats of scarcity, change what it means to be a thinking, feeling human?

For American authors of the 18th and 19th century, love and madness were twinned sites of altered consciousness that represented the radical ""others"" of Enlightenment reason, psychic parallels to and extensions of the wilds of the New World and the uncontrollable crowds and freedoms of the new democracy.

We will also ask: familiar/strange to whom? and work to make explicit the expectations readers bring to different works. By honing our sense of audience, we will deepen our ability to connect as writers. Potential readings include: Arundhati Roy, Toni Morrison, Justin Torres, Dorothy Tse, Samanta Schweblin, Octavia Butler. Prerequisite(s): ENGL 150 taken at Macalester.",
ENGL 284-01,10294,Crafts of Writing: Screenwriting, T R,01:20 pm-02:50 pm,MAIN 002,Richard Pelster-Wiebe, Closed 4 / 16,"When we watch movies and TV shows, it’s hard sometimes to remember how these works are actually born. Before the actors say a word, or the post-production team adds that perfect shade of pink to the sunset, a film or television show lives solely on the page. It lives as a piece of writing created in the mind of a storyteller. No matter what happens later, it always begins as a reading experience. In this course, we will concentrate on every aspect of that initial and vital stage of creating visual stories. We will study produced scripts to see how they master visual storytelling, pitch perfect dialogue, and satisfying structure. While there is no paint-by-numbers formula for a perfect screenplay or teleplay, there is a constantly evolving form full of principles the greatest writers have relied on since the birth of these mediums. Throughout the semester we will study this form in depth then we will workshop your developing scripts with an eye toward making them ideal stories for the screen, both large and small.

You can spend an hour reading a story in which three hundred years pass – or a year reading a book that takes place within a single hour. Fiction has the marvelous ability to propel a reader backwards and forwards and sideways in time, and in this class we’ll examine the tools that let us, as writers, enact that propulsion. We will look at fiction that adheres to linear time as well as fiction that meets time-challenges head on (such as time-travel narratives and stories with multiple timelines), and we’ll learn how to manage our readers’ time – how to get someone whipping through your pages, and how to get them to slow down and savor the moment. Required texts will likely include “This is How You Lose the Time War” by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, “Cassandra at the Wedding” by Dorothy Baker, and stories by authors such as Mariana Enriquez, Charlie Jane Anders, and Lucia Berlin.

Somerset Maugham, “and we’re foolish when we ask anything to last, but surely we’re more foolish not to take delight while we have it.” The aim of this course, therefore, is to grab a semester’s worth of delight via an eclectic array of British and American novels, stories, plays, and essays that take delight as seriously as “high literature” takes suffering. We’ll begin with a few foundational texts before skipping off toward the hijinks of romantic comedy, screwball comedy, observational humor, cozy mysteries, satire, and farce, many of which were penned in decidedly non-delightful circumstances, and by occasionally non-delightful people. As our delight grows, we’ll ask a wide range of questions about genre, form, voice, reception, representation, the politics of taste, and the nature of protest art, paying particular attention to...well, to everything, since attention is delight’s skeleton key. “Look at a child!” cried Dostoyevsky in The Idiot. “Look at the grass, how it grows! Look at the eyes that gaze at you and love you!” Coursework will include reading responses, two short essays, a presentation and a final project. Creative writers (or those so inclined) will have the opportunity to write creatively for certain assignments. Non-majors are invited, so long as they’re easily delighted.",

And if not, you’re definitely in for a treat. Zadie Smith was born in England to a Jamaican mother and British father and writes about technology, education and the Ivory Tower, and the complicated ways gender, sexuality, race, and socioeconomic class intertwine in our lives. Scottish writer Ali Smith was a Virginia Woolf scholar before she turned to creative writing. Her books explore queer identity, human rights and the refugee crisis, chronic illness, and the capacity for visual art to connect people across time and space. Both of these writers invite readers into the difficult spaces of life, challenging us to read with compassion while also thinking about how to make the world a better place—in their work, the personal is always political. As a class, we will read a selection of novels, short stories, and essays by The Smiths and discuss these texts through a series of creative and scholarly prompts.",

This course will look at texts that purposely decenter the marriage plot and its traditional associations, questioning the emotional and physical cost in its aftermath and/or absence. We will consider fundamental questions such as, how does this decentering unsettle social norms and disrupt conventional pathways for narrative development? Possible course texts include Elizabeth Gaskell’s Ruth, Anne Brontë’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, George Gissing’s The Odd Women, sections from Emily Westmeath’s memoir, and selections of poetry from writers like Dante Gabriel Rossetti.",

How was bodymind normativity, ability, and disability defined in the Renaissance? Why did writers turn to literature to explore illness and disability? And where might we discover evidence of disability gain or disability pride in the early modern archive? We’ll be reading a variety of genres: medical literature, herbals (self-help remedy books written for lay people), law books, joke books, ballads, poetry, and drama.

The creation process is situated within the research activity and produces critically informed work in a variety of media (art forms)."" [From the SSHRC website.] As a literary scholar, what does it mean to do interdisciplinary research? What is humane about the humanities? How might a research-creation framework help you become a better custodian of our planet? Or help solve social problems like bigotry, xenophobia, or racism? How does writing across media expand your sense of how academic writing communicates with an audience? Is your academic research intersectional, and why might that be important? Our capstone course will begin with an overview of research-creation as both a research method and as a model for social justice or activism. Students will develop their capstone research paper in consultation with their peers and the professor. The topic is up to you—but you should expect to produce a final project rooted in both creative praxis and traditional research, which will be presented in an academic paper that exists alongside an additional form of creative expression (artwork, photojournalism, podcast, web archive, artist’s book, comic, etc).",

Human population growth has resulted in unprecedented changes in our planet’s ecosystems.  Species have been lost, modified, and forced to live in concrete jungles. Human history, culture and socio-political nuances in different parts of the world result in distinctive challenges as well as enigmatically optimistic scenarios with respect to wildlife conservation. In this seminar we will investigate perspectives from South Asia where animals and humans coexist at very high density and proximity, consider the North American system where views about biodiversity can often be very polarizing, and explore conservation in Africa where pockets of pristine wilderness persist. We will engage with the primary literature of wildlife conservation, hear from scientists on the frontlines, and discuss the idea that there could be a unifying model that safeguards biodiversity without detrimentally impeding human development.

In 1854, the same year that Thoreau published Walden, the French created the Société Nationale de la Protection de la Nature.  And in 1861 the first Réserve Naturelle was created by the French government to protect the forests of Fontainebleau from clear cutting, due in large part to the well-written petitions by writers and artists such as Victor Hugo, George Sand, and others.  In this course, we will look at a number of literary, cultural, and political texts written during the nineteenth century that focus on nature, the environment, and issues related to the rapid urbanization and industrialization of France.  We will also study artworks by the Barbizon school, and by later artists including the impressionists of the later part of the nineteenth century.  Texts will include works by well-known authors such as Honoré de Balzac, George Sand, and Emile Zola, but also less well-known writers Olympe Audouard and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore among others.  We will also study a variety of contemporary critical theories on the subject, from Claude Brosseau's Romans-Géographes and Bertrand Westphal's La Géocritique to Blanc, Pughe et Chartier's works on l'écopoétique. In the end, we will try to answer the question of why and how the green movement developed in France and why it has been so different (some would say ""behind"") the ecology movements of other western nations in Europe and in North America.

What makes it unique? How does French food translate French culture? What changes occurred throughout history? From medieval recipes to the first public restaurants, from the introduction of the first tomato dish to the new trends in branding water, chocolate, tea, vanilla or coffee, we will explore different topics related to food in France and the Francophone world, such as: the impact of travel and colonialism on French food and on food in French colonies as well as resulting global inequities; the significance of rituals and traditions associated with food. These questions will be addressed through a variety of films, media and texts. The course will provide a frame to engage creatively with issues of sustainability in Western and non-Western francophone cultures and communities through the study of representations, production, circulation and consumption of food. From cheese stories to existentialist cafés in Paris, from Haitian sugar to North African couscous and Bourbon Island vanilla, the course will explore our connection to food, locally and globally, including how the covid-19 pandemic affected food security. The course has a double objective: to familiarize students with French and Francophone cultures and to introduce students to different and innovative ways of considering sustainability issues from different cultural perspectives. The format of the course is a seminar, based on student discussions, research, and presentations. There will be ample opportunities to build community in the course regardless of the mode of delivery. Please note that the final project of the course will be a collaborative one.

In this course, we will gain perspective on our contemporary situation and attitudes through the analysis of French fiction, art, film, and graphic novels associated with the genre of science fiction. The works we will study are drawn from a wide range of contexts and historical periods, but all take as their principal themes speculation on technology and science; travel in time and space; human nature and its limits and our differences from other terrestrial and extra-terrestrial beings; and utopian or dystopian representations of the future. What do these French science fiction works tell us about how we should understand technology as a distinct form of human endeavor? What do they also tell us about what it means to be human or even posthuman? Are French science fiction works a projection or ""journey into fear"" reflecting only the anxieties of the historical moments that produce them, or can they suggest real possibilities for radical social transformation? How have French science fiction works contributed to the development of the science fiction genre, and to what extent do they reflect a specifically French attitude to technology and science? Texts and films studied will include some prophetic early literary works such as Cyrano de Bergerac's L’Autre monde, ou les états et empires de la lune (1657) and Louis-Sebastien Mercier's 1771 novel L’An 2440; the fiction of Jules Verne; the speculative art of J.J. Grandville; graphic novels including Jodorowsky and Moebius's L’Incal (1982); and films including Marker's La Jetée (1962); Franju's classic take on plastic surgery Les Yeux sans visage (1960); Godard's Alphaville (1965); and Laloux's La Planète savuage (1973). Our discussions will also be informed by short readings of theorists of technology including Donna Haraway, Frederic Jameson, Heidegger, Bruno Latour, and Pierre Macherey. The course will be taught in French in a discussion format. Prerequisite: French 204.",

In the end, we will try to answer the question of why and how the green movement developed in France and why it has been so different (some would say ""behind"") the ecology movements of other western nations in Europe and in North America.

Defined this way, cyborgs are present wherever people grow attached to their technology: from brain-computer interfaces, to artificial limbs, to you and your smartphone. Arguably, humans have always been cyborgs, all the way back to homo sapiens—the animal whose distinguishing characteristic was their use of tools. In this course, we will explore the cyborg across a wide range of cultural and theoretical sources, from literature (E.T.A Hoffmann’s “The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,” on which the ballet is based; Goethe’s Faust; Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein) to film (Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, the main inspiration for Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner) to material history (puppets, marionettes, and 19th-century toy manufacturing in Nuremberg). We’ll read philosophical anthropology on the idea of the human as deficient being, compelled to reinvent itself with tools and technology in order to survive. Discussion topics will include: what does the cyborg in culture and theory tell us about the limits of the human? Where does culture begin and biology end? Why are cyborgs either hyper-gendered, androgenous, or both at the same time, and what does this tell us about gender? Weekly reading responses; several short essays spread over the semester; a final, building on the shorter essays. The course counts for the argumentative writing and internationalism general education requirements. Taught in English; no prerequisites.","Writing WA

Artists and intellectuals such as Charlie Chaplin, Angela Davis, Banksy, and Diego Rivera have grappled with these issues. In this course, we will explore the intersection of politics and aesthetics by focusing on significant ideas, artworks, and debates in the history of Marxist thought. Guided by our readings in Marxist philosophy and art theory, we will critically examine a variety of artworks, art movements (Futurism, DADA, Socialist Realism, Situationist International), and artforms (fairy tales, film, painting, photography, poetry, theater). We will also discuss broader issues at the intersection of art and politics such as:  perception and the politics of the senses; labor and technological reproduction; commercialization and the culture industry; epistemic violence and language; global capitalism and colonialism.

This will allow us to examine the ways in which secular thought emerges not as an alternative to metaphysics-something which thought cannot supersede anyway-but rather as a different way of dealing with the very same metaphysical questions and issues that concern religion, from the meaning of life to the imminence of death, and from (actual or imagined) guilt to the hope for redemption.

Students in our collaborative First-Year Course will explore this question from historical, artistic, and scientific perspectives. The Enlightenment approach to naming, categorizing, and representing the diversity of life dominates current academic science.  Military activity enabled the work of key founding figures of this tradition; e.g., Charles Darwin’s critical insights were made as part of a British naval expedition whose ultimate goal was to maintain and expand colonial power.  This approach to understanding nature has been practiced through striking traditions of drawing, printmaking, taxidermy, and cabinets of curiosities. Students will confront the practices and institutions of the biodiversity sciences in historical and political context.  We will engage with indigenous counter-narratives and approaches to understanding nature outside of normative European colonial practices.  Finally, we will work together to think critically about how we might decolonize institutions such as museums of natural history, approaches to visual culture and the biodiversity sciences more generally. Course activities will include active visual interpretation of nature through the production of artistic works, fieldtrips to museums such as the Minnesota Insect Collection and the Bell Museum of Natural History, and interpretation of archival materials such as Macalester’s Encyclopedie (Diderot), the Wangensteen Library’s Surinaamsche insecten engravings by Maria Sibylla Merian or the Science Museum of Minnesota’s Amazonian collection.

When completed, the pipeline will transport an estimated 800,000 barrels a day of fracked, tar sands oil (the equivalent of 50 coal-fired power plants or 38 million vehicles) from Alberta, Canada to Lake Superior, threatening local and global life. The pipeline crosses the Mississippi River and hundreds of other bodies of water and wetlands crucial to sustaining human and non-human life. It also extends the lifetime of the world’s dependence on fossil fuels, contributing to potentially irreparable climate change and global mass species extinction. In addition to its environmental impacts, the pipeline has direct links to issues of racial justice that recall this past summer’s George Floyd uprising. Its construction has ignored Native sovereignty and treaty rights, reproducing systems of racial injustice and inequality that connect the Twin Cities to Northern Minnesota, Black Lives to Native Lives Matter. In conversation and/or collaboration with Indigenous and allied organizations working against the pipeline (including Honor the Earth, MN 350, Stop Line 3, the Giniw Collective, and others), this class will articulate the problem of the Line 3 pipeline through the lens of Media and Cultural Studies while drawing interdisciplinarily on other fields and other case studies for context and perspective.

Our guiding principle will be that TV matters. And we will ask not just what ideas and practices it produces, but, importantly, how it produces them and how they have changed over time. Starting in the postwar period, we will trace the emergence of television culture, mostly within the United States, and think about how this particular media institution shaped, and was shaped by, its social and historical context. Specifically, this portion will focus on how the television was constructed as a domestic appliance and was used as an instrument for producing and policing the ideal or normative family. Then, the course will examine the history and politics of racial representation on television, starting with the symbiotic relationship between the civil rights movement and television news institutions in the mid-20th century. We will follow this into the present, with particular emphasis on television’s role in molding ideas about policing, protest, and racism. Throughout, we will consider the distinct textual, aesthetic, and stylistic aspects of individual television programs as well as the larger discursive environment in which they operate.

It intends to introduce students to the study of music (and, by association, arts in general) from social, cultural, and critical perspectives, using the framework of freedom as a common theme. It also aims to contextualize the discourse of human rights within the history of arts and ideas, providing students with a a sense of the term's changing meanings and emphases over time and across space. We will explore traditions in both Western art music (also known as ""classical music"") and the American popular (recorded) music in a search for ways in which music has served social-political ideologies - overtly through the aims of its composers and performers, and unintentionally through the conditions of its reception. Historical readings on the concept of freedom from a variety of disciplinary perspectives (history, philosophy, political science, critical theory) will introduce students to several of the most influential thinkers on the subject and the central concerns and questions that animate the discourse on freedom. No prior background in music is required for the course, although it is assumed that students will have a true interest not only in popular music of the twentieth century but also other traditions and genres, such as opera and symphonic music.

We’ll also acquaint ourselves with an array of figures in western and non-western traditions. Between life and death, there is only one factor that is truly common to all human experience: time. But what is time? St. Augustine famously says that he knows what time is until someone asks him to explain what it is. We’ll start by exploring whether time flows, what sempiternity and eternity are, and what the difference between the past, present, and future might be. Once we get a grip on this time thing that we all occupy, we’ll move on to Truth. What can we hope to know? Do we live in a simulation? Who should we trust, and how do we build a coherent understanding of the world? What is truth, anyway? Lastly, we’ll move on to perhaps the most important: meaning. What is the purpose of life? Does such a question even make sense? Where do my values come from? We’ll explore theism, existentialism, antinatalism and others as views that offer competing answers to these questions.",Writing WA

Think about it: when was the last time you heard anyone say: Aristotle, he’s so hilarious!?  The seriousness of philosophy can hide how much philosophers have thought about play and how philosophical thinking itself can be a playful activity. In this class, we’ll be exploring a number of questions related to play and playfulness. What is(are) the point(s) of play? What are we doing when we engage in playful behavior?  How do we experience time in play? What is the relationship between our play time and philosophical time? What can we learn about ourselves and the world through the frame of play?  How is play related to being a child, to making and understanding art, to participating in festivals and other celebratory activities, and to resisting dominant political regimes?  We’ll start out the course with a brief glance back at the 19th century philosopher Friedrich Schiller’s thoughts on how the spontaneity involved in play makes us human. From here we’ll move on to look at play directly through the lenses of some 20th century philosophical work, starting with Eugen Fink’s Play as the Symbol of the World and running through Guy Debord’s vision of the potential of play as spilling over into “real life.” Toward the end of the course we’ll discuss how what we’ve learned can assist in analyzing contemporary play-related phenomena such as gamification. Yes, there will be confetti, and you will on occasion have an opportunity to play in addition to talking and writing about it.

We draw upon literature in political science, media studies, neuroscience, and psychology to help answer this question, as well as podcasts by scholars, politicians, and social movement advocates.  Students will systematically design their own political podcast series and produce three short podcast episodes. The course is appropriate for first-year students. One does not need a prior background in political science or experience in audio recording to succeed in this course. The popularity of podcasts as journalistic and political phenomena skyrocketed in 2014 thanks to a long-form, non-fiction podcast called “Serial,” produced by the radio show, This American Life. Today, thousands of politically oriented podcasts are available to listeners around the world.  The relative ease of recording and publishing one’s ideas makes podcasts a truly democratic form of political debate and discourse, as well as a significant driver of polarization and political animosity. This course focuses on three topics of significant interest to contemporary political scientists: political polarization, increasing authoritarianism, and widespread threats to liberal democracy. Political podcasts differ in format and should be understood as different rhetorical genres such as soliloquies, formal debates, and Platonic-style dialogues. The course will situate political podcasting as one of several phenomena that suggest we have entered what Walter Ong calls a new “age of orality.”",

Participants will discover the design field’s history and theoretical underpinnings as well as how to make socially-meaningful designs through hands-on projects. Throughout the course, we will investigate the processes and practices of design as well as the effects that design has on society, culture, and the environment. Some of our key topics will include issues of gender and race; consumption, social responsibility, and globalization; and politics and activism. The course will take advantage of campus resources including the new Studio Art and Theater facilities, the Idea Lab, the Digital Resource Center, and the Entrepreneurship Office. We will also connect with local designers who will open their studios to us and join us in creative discussions. This course will be co-taught by faculty from three different departments: Julia Chadaga (Russian Studies), Joanna Inglot (Art and Art History), and Mina Kinukawa (Theater and Dance). Each section will cover the same material and meet at the same time. Students will have opportunities to work with all three professors, occasionally meet up with students in the other sections, and take local field trips together if health and safety conditions allow. All of the participating departments will allow the course to count for a major or minor. No previous experience with design is required, and all are welcome.","Writing WA

How is it similar to other methods to react to and to attempt to control unwanted behavior? What are the social consequences of these formal institutions of social control? In this course, we examine these developments in the processes and organization of social control, paying particular attention to criminal behavior and formal, legal responses to crime. We study and evaluate sociological theories of criminal behavior to understand how social forces influence levels of crimes. We examine recent criminal justice policies in the United States and their connections to inequality, examining the processes that account for expanding criminalization. Finally, we compare the development of formal, bureaucratic systems of social control and informal methods of social control, paying attention to the social and political implications of these developments.","Writing WA

The two benefactors of this system are (1) those who are at the apex of the system, the so-called 1% and (2) the highly-educated elite professionals, intellectuals, and managerial class, the next 9% and sometimes called the clergy or the secular high priests of the system. The remaining population, largely composed of less educated whites, minorities, blacks, and women are being further and further removed from the rewards of the system. This hyper-inegalitarian system of rule is now experiencing a legitimacy crisis by both the far right and the left, but no true alternatives have yet been proposed to reform or replace it. The far right wants to take us on a path of racial white supremacist rule and further escalate inequalities. The far left wants to create a system of radical democracy and respect for nature. This course will identify this historical system's distinctive dynamics so that we may better determine what is needed to resolve it. With that in mind, as Nancy Fraser has argued, we need to seek a path forward that leads beyond the current impasse -- through political realignments to societal transformation.

Core themes include the social construction of childhood, children’s agency, and debates surrounding children’s rights in a global context. We will consider various case studies of contemporary children’s and youth issues, including growing up trans and what that reveals about society’s ideas about gender identity more broadly; how children cope and recover following disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and wildfires; and how children and youth can participate and lead in electoral politics and social movements. Finally, we will discuss contemporary research on how, why, and with what consequences the transition to adulthood has become stratified, scrambled, or only partially realized because of systems of oppression and privilege.
