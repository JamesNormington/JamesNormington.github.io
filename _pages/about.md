Welcome to my page! I am a statistician, currently serving as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College. I use he/him/his pronouns.


I am passionate about teaching statistics. In my teaching, I follow three central principles: (i) foster active learning with real world data examples, (ii) emphasize statistical thinking over statistical procedure, and (iii) cultivate a diverse, equitable, and inclusive learning environment that is informative, engaging, and accessible for students of all backgrounds and beliefs. Currently, I apply these principles in STAT 155 (Introduction to Statistical Modeling) at Macalester.


My research interests revolve around using Bayesian hierarchical modeling to solve complex problems. I have applied this wide-ranging methodology to problems involving health care policy, adaptive clinical trial designs, and, more recently, media mix modeling and time series. I have several publications and am always open to collaboration -- please see the Research tab for more information!


I'm also very interested in how a student's culture affects their learning of statistics. Recently, I've been thinking a lot about deficit vs. strengths-based pedagogy. Specifically, how are the real world data examples I use in my classroom experienced by people of different backgrounds, and does that lead to disparities in their learning of statistics?
